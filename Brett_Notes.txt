Setting up UV and Ruff was difficult, but this effort should make it simpler for others.
Key thing to remember: Everything is run through uv. had to run setup with
    uv run lerobot-setup-motors --robot.type=so101_follower --robot.port=COM7
Performed calibration with:
    uv run lerobot-calibrate --robot.type=so101_follower --robot.port=COM4 --robot.id=Jack_the_Gripper
Performed teleoperation:
    noted that calibration of follower (done at the lab) was not complete range of motion for the elbow. 
    otherwise, successful
    Teleoperation noted that there was not a calibration available for the leader arm and forced me to perform a calibration
    The script for calibration and teleoperation does not give an option for saving the calibration to a particular location, nor does it ask you where one might be.
    
TODO:
    Figure out how to manipulate individual joints

On my laptop:
    COM4 is follower
    COM7 is leader

Homework 3 - Lab Portion

Copy and pasted scripts directly from course website
    - set_position.py
    - read_position.py
    - so101_utils.py

The utils script contains two pasted sections, with a total of 4 helper functions
    - load_calibration
    - setup_motors
    - move_to_pose
    - hold_position

Ran the calibration again
Ran the script to read position - Annoyingly, it continously prints to the terminal. 
Verified that Zero position matches that shown in the course website
Script for motion between start and desired position works, but still has jerky behavior
Current best values
P: 30, D: 5
