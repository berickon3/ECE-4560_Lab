Setting up UV and Ruff was difficult, but this effort should make it simpler for others.
Key thing to remember: Everything is run through uv. had to run setup with
    uv run lerobot-setup-motors --robot.type=so101_follower --robot.port=COM7
Performed calibration with:
    uv run lerobot-calibrate --robot.type=so101_follower --robot.port=COM7 --robot.id=Jack_the_Gripper
