Setting up UV and Ruff was difficult, but this effort should make it simpler for others.
Key thing to remember: Everything is run through uv. had to run setup with
    uv run lerobot-setup-motors --robot.type=so101_follower --robot.port=COM7
Performed calibration with:
    uv run lerobot-calibrate --robot.type=so101_follower --robot.port=COM7 --robot.id=Jack_the_Gripper
Performed teleoperation:
    noted that calibration of follower (done at the lab) was not complete range of motion for the elbow. 
    otherwise, successful
    Teleoperation noted that there was not a calibration available for the leader arm and forced me to perform a calibration
    The script for calibration and teleoperation does not give an option for saving the calibration to a particular location, nor does it ask you where one might be.
    
TODO:
    Figure out how to manipulate individual joints

On my laptop:
    COM4 is follower
    COM7 is leader
